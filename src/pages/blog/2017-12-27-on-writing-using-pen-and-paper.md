There was a time that I used to enjoy writing with pen and paper. Whether it was taking notes in class, in meetings or during my personal times of study, there was this feeling of statisfaction of putting ideas, discussions and thoughts to paper.

I still enjoy writing. But since I moved to keeping the items that I carry with me to the bare minimum, the notebook didn't make the cut. I still carry a **pen**, but mainly for those rare moments when you need to sign or fill in paper forms (I'm looking at you Custom's Declaration Cards).

I obviously still take notes, but I use modern devices now. iPhone, iPad or my laptop are what I use today. I don't get the same feeling of satisfaction as I did when I used pen and paper, but something else has replaced it - the statisfaction of syncing.

## Syncing

Taking notes on my smartphone and then finishing those notes using my laptop or iPad is truly great. I could obviously never do that with a paper notebook. This was the future I was waiting for.

Another important reason I don't take notes with pen and paper anymore and the reason I am most grateful for digital note taking...my handwriting is awful.
