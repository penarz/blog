![terminal window](/img/terminal1.jpg)

I used to look up this command often as I like working in the terminal window on MacOS. There is this satisfying feeling of typing a command and pressing the enter/return key (Mac Keyboard) to delete a directory and it's entire contents. 

```zsh
rm -rf foldername
```

Where **foldername** is the directory, and it's respective contents, that you want to completely delete.

*Please use wisely*
